# KuroVoice
A simple run-of-the-mill speech recognition chatbot capable of listening and replying using the [System.Speech](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Speech/ "Link to NuGet: System.Speech") NuGet package. Written in C#; created in .NET Core WinForms.

### Features:
- Control buttons (start/stop).
- Display input.
- Display output/reply.
- Reply with artificial voice.


### ‚ùó Disclaimers:
- This is a quick side-project. I'm not accepting issues and PRs. Improvements and bug fixes will be done the next time I'm bored. 
- This software does not use any ML (Machine Learning) model or concept when generating a reply. Data is hard-coded.
